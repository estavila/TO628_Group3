OXFORD COVID-19 GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRACKER: aims to track and compare government responses to the coronavirus outbreak worldwide rigorously and consistently. We can analyze how specific government measures affect outcomes in terms of COVID cases and deaths.
https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker

13 Measures Tracked by Oxford:
S1_School closing
S2_Workplace closing
S3_Cancel public events
S4_Close public transport
S5_Public information campaigns
S6_Restrictions on internal movement
S7_International travel controls
S8_Fiscal measures
S9_Monetary measures
S10_Emergency investment in health care
S11_Investment in Vaccines
S12_Testing framework
S13_Contact tracing
+
ConfirmedCases; ConfirmedDeaths; StringencyIndex

Interesting analysis of Oxford data:
https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker?ref=researchstash

Oxford has a StringencyIndex that measures how stringent each government has reacted. I thought, maybe we can introduce Proactivity index - how many measures country has introduced before first ConfirmedCase and first ConfirmedDeath. I assume this affects the outcomes as well. Then one of our questiond would be: What has been more effective stringency or proactivity?
